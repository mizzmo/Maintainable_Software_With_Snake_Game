### Introduction.

### Initial Notes on the Code.
- All code and assets are contained within the same directory "example".
- There seems to be no naming conventions for files 
- Random comments are left in the code.
- Where there are comments, they dont mean anything.
- Most code is left completely unexplained.
- There are methods that dont do anything in the code.
- There doesn't seem to be any obvious design pattern used here.
