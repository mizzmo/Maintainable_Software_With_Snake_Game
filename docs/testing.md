## Testing
My first round of testing will be to check that all of the method getters and setters, 
as well as all of the non-gui based methods work correctly using JUnit.
<br>
I will write tests for all of these methods, and run these tests to check that they work correctly.

- Controller Tests - All Pass.
- SnakeBody Tests - All Pass.
- SnakeModel Tests - All Pass.
- SnakeObject Tests - All Pass
- SnakeFood Tests - All Pass.
- SnakeMusicUtil Tests - All Pass.
- SnakeWall Tests - All Pass.

Next I need to run some user tests to check that the GUI elements all work correctly.
<br>
I will do this by scene, rather than by class to make it easier to structure my tests, 
as some scenes stretch over muliple classes.

### Main Menu Tests.
- Does the music play?
  - The user can hear the menu music playing while they are on the menu screen.
- Does the music loop correctly?
  - The music does loop after the song finishes playing.
- Are all the buttons clickable?
  - All the buttons are clickable and animated.
- Do all the buttons take you to their labeled location?
  - Does the exit button exit the game?
    - When you press the exit button, the game exits.
  - Does the Leaderboard button take you to the leaderboard page?
    - When you click leaderboard, it changes scenes to the leaderboard page.
  - Does the Settings button take you to the settings page?
    - When you click settings, it takes you to the settings page.
  - Does the Start button take you to the game select screen?
    - When you click start, it changes scenes to the map select page.
