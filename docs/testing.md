## Testing
My first round of testing will be to check that all of the method getters and setters, 
as well as all of the non-gui based methods work correctly using JUnit.
<br>
I will write tests for all of these methods, and run these tests to check that they work correctly.

- Controller Tests - All Pass.
- SnakeBody Tests - All Pass.
- SnakeModel Tests - All Pass.
- SnakeObject Tests - All Pass
- SnakeFood Tests - All Pass.
- SnakeMusicUtil Tests - All Pass.
- SnakeWall Tests - All Pass.

Next I need to run some user tests to check that the GUI elements all work correctly.
<br>
I will do this by scene, rather than by class to make it easier to structure my tests, 
as some scenes stretch over muliple classes.
