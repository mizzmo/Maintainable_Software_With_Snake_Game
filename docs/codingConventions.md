## Coding Conventions.
For this project I plan to enforce some basic coding conventions to ensure that my project is more maintainable for the future
and easier to understand at the present.
- Limit on method length; **Methods should be totally visible on a single page** without scrolling. (*Excluding Main.*)
- Methods should use **no more than 5 levels of indentation.**
- Line length needs to be **less than 80 characters long.**
- All **Class Variables should start with "m_"** to signify that they are a member of a class.
- Any constants should be **written in all capital letters**.
- Have use of **Getters and Setters** to access member variables.
- Getters and Setters should be **defined at the top of the Class.**
- Any Member Variable should be **defined as Private.** (*Excluding Constants.*)
- Any Private Method should **begin with a lower case letter.**
- Any Public Method should **begin with an upper case letter.**
- Methods should have **no more than 5 parameters.** (*Overloaded Methods should be used in the case where more parameters are needed.*)
- Contants should be **Symbolic, not Numerical**.
