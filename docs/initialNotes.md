## Initial Notes on the Code.
- All code and assets are contained within the same directory "example".
- There seems to be no naming conventions for files 
- Random comments are left in the code.
- Where there are comments, they dont mean anything.
- Most code is left completely unexplained.
- There are methods that dont do anything in the code.
- There are unused methods in the code.
- There are classes inside classes, leading to confusing code.
- There doesn't seem to be any obvious design pattern used here.
- There is an interface with only one method that is only used once, seems redundant.
- Duplicated methods resulting in excessive code.

## Proposed Immidiate Changes
- Split out the code and assets into seperate folders.
- Refactor code to account for this change.
- Establish new naming and coding conventions to be implemented into this code.
- Remove unneeded files and code snippets. (*Unused Files Etc.*)
- Go through and comment all existing code.
- Establish a MVC design pattern in the code.
- Rename files to be simpler and more expressive.
- Seperate out the nested classes into seperate files.
- Either remove the interface, or improve it to house more methods.
- Remove repeated methods, adapt instead to include more functionality.
- Remove unused variables.
